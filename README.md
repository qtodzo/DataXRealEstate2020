#        Pandas (organizing various data into readable data tables)
#        GeoPandas (organizing and manipulating geotagged data, which when installed should come with Shapely and other geoprocessing   packages)
#        Modules used in Web Scraping:
#            requests 
#            BeautifulSoup 
#            regular expression
#            warnings
#        Pickle (for transfering outputs between code scripts)
#        Datetime (dealing with dates and time operations)
#        PyAstronomy (for converting dates to decimals for plotting purposes)
#        geopy (for getting the specific address of each listing)
#        Flask (for running the actual UI)
#        wtforms (for helping build the user input)
